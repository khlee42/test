# Representation

<!-- This is how computers understand real-world objects. A series of preset binary sequences that represents something in the real world and can be rendered back to its original form so human can understand. -->

- Number
- Text
- Image
- Sound
- Video

# Control

<!-- How decisions are made or rules are carried out. It sequentially proceeds, branches out upon certain conditions, and repeat. This is what makes what we call function or algorithm. A set of rules on how actions should be performed. -->

- Sequence
- Selection
- Iteration
- ...

# Abstraction

<!-- We don't need to know how car engines work in order to drive. -->

- Function
- Class
- Module
- Package
- Library
- Framework
- ...

---

<!-- We enter some input, a form of representation of real world objects, into a box that carries out certain rules, and get the output of the box, again in a form of representation. This is the most basic and fundamental unit of computer programs. -->

# Assignment 1

- Create your first program in Scratch
- Requirements:
    - Your project must use at least two sprites
    - Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
    - Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
    - Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
- `File`>`Save to your computer` will download your program (`.sb3`)
- Upload your program to the myCourses course page.
- Due next week
